**Overview**<br>

This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations by analyzing user ratings and interactions with movies in a dataset. The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering, a common technique in recommendation systems, to suggest movies that users might like based on similarities with other users' preferences.

**Libraries Used**<br>

**Python 3.10**<br>
**Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.<br>
**nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing tasks.<br>
**Cosine similarity**: Metric used to measure similarity between movies.<br>
**Streamlit**: Streamlit is a framework used for building web applications with Python. <br>

**Procedure**<br>

Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing user ratings and movie metadata.<br>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and format the data for modeling.<br>
Model Building: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based or item-based approaches using libraries like Surprise.<br>
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using cosine similarity.<br>
Deployment: Deploy the trained model to provide real-time recommendations based on user inputs.<br>

**Project Description**<br>

The project is structured to provide a seamless movie recommendation experience based on users' historical ratings. It focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict and recommend movies that users are likely to enjoy. The system caters to both new users with minimal data and existing users with a history of interactions.

**Conclusion**<br>

This movie recommendation system demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in enhancing user experience by providing personalized recommendations. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques, the system suggests movies that align with users' tastes and preferences, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.
